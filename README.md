## What is this?
Spellify is a web app that helps you better study for your spelling tests.

## How does it work?
You simply upload your spelling list PDF file (i.e. the doc that your elementary school teacher would usually give you) and the app then launches an interactive training session.
For each word in the list, it speaks out the word and can also give you a definiton of the word, use it in a sentence, and much more!
Think of Spellify as your ultimate study assistant for spelling tests.

## What is this made of?
- NodeJS running an ExpressJS app (backend)
- jQuery (front-end)

## Why did you build this?
I developed this app to help my sister to study for her weekly spelling tests.

## Can I use it?
Currently, the app's way of parsing the uploaded spelling words list (PDF file) is specific to the document style of the spelling lists that my sister's teacher used to hand out.
So, the app might not be able to automatically parse other styles of spelling list files.

If you find a more generic way for parsing the uploaded spelling list file, then please send me a PR!

Enjoy!
